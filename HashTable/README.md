## HASHTABLE - DATA STRUCTURES AND ALGORITHMS

**What is a hashtable?**

A hashtable is a data structure that stores key-value pairs. It uses a hash function to compute an index into an array of buckets or slots, from which the desired value can be found.

**What is a hash function?**

A hash function is a function that can be used to map a data of arbitrary size to data of fixed size. The values returned by a hash function are called hash values, hash codes, digests, or simply hashes. The values are used to index a fixed-size table called a hash table. Use of a hash function to index a hash table is called hashing or scatter storage addressing.

**Why do we use hashtables?**

* Hash tables are a data structure that utilize key value pairs. This means every Node or Bucket has both a key, and a value.
  
## Analysis of Hash Tables

* Hash tables are very fast at finding, adding, and removing values!
*  O(1) time complexity
*  Hash tables are very slow at finding values if we don't have the key.
*  can be O(n) time complexity
*  Hash tables can't store things in order!
*  Hash tables don't have indexes!
*  Hash tables can't have duplicate keys!
*  Hash tables are not ordered!
